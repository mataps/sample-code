But among Filipinos, Bicolanos stand out. It is because Bicolanos have dreams and not like others they give their very best to make their dreams come true. Dreams that they will always pursue and continue to reach. Amidst all the challenges that will come their way and obstacles that can hinder them and will make their dreams somewhat unreachable, they will always find ways to reach those dreams. Bicolanos who have shown these qualities and eagerness are the following: John Paul Taday, Baao Children and Youth Choir, and Kristian Cordero. They are Certified Oragons! They just don&#39;t simply reach their dreams for their own good but also touch other Bicolanos&#39; lives and inspire Filipinos. They serve as guide and instruments to show the world that Bicolanos don&#39;t easily give up and have faith in God. <BR><BR/><strong>Team Members: </strong><ul>Precious Mae Torres</br>Frances Gwyneth Danielle Savilla</br>Danica Gravito</br>Roni Alexia Udarbe</br>Kenneth Marvin Adaque</br>Charles Jayson Vargas</br>Mary Katherine Balane</br>Alyssa Mae Borja</ul></p><BR><BR/></div>]]></description>
